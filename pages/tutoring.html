                    <h2>Expert Knowledge</h2>
                    <p>As a First Class Master's graduate in Engineering Mathematics from the University of Bristol, I
                        offer a wealth of
                        expertise and practical experience in tutoring mathematics, physics, engineering, and computer
                        science. My academic
                        journey reflects a consistent track record of excellence, including outstanding results at GCSE
                        and earning one A* and four A's at A-Level (prior to the
                        COVID-19 pandemic). Furthermore, I maintained a First Class average each year of my university
                        degree, as well as in my masters thesis, with many units
                        exceeding 80%.
                    </p>

                    <p>My academic achievements are complemented by my deep understanding of how to apply theoretical
                        knowledge to real-world
                        problems. I am adept at providing valuable insights into exam preparation, offering effective
                        tips and techniques
                        for mastering complex subjects. Furthermore, my experience as a Teaching Assistant at the
                        University of Bristol has
                        refined my ability to explain challenging material, engage students, and support diverse
                        learning needs. Combining
                        high academic performance with hands-on teaching experience, I am well-positioned to offer
                        expert tutoring that
                        helps students excel and develop a strong grasp of these critical disciplines.
